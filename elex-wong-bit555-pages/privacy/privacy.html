                        A cookie is a piece of information in the form of a very small text file that is placed on an internet user's computer. It is generated 
                        by a web page server (which is basically the computer that operates the website) and can be used by that server whenever the user visits 
                        the site. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card, which tells a website when the user has returned. Cookies 
                        can't harm your computer and we don't store any personally identifiable information about you on any of our cookies.
